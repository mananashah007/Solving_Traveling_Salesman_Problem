# TSP Solver Project â€“ Nearest Insertion, Primâ€™s, and Branch & Bound Algorithms
This project solves the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using three different algorithms:

Nearest Insertion

Primâ€™s Algorithm

Branch and Bound

It utilizes HERE Maps API to fetch real-world coordinates and compute distances between cities.

ðŸ“š Project Overview
Objective:
Solve the TSP by computing the most optimal or near-optimal route for visiting a list of cities based on real-world geographical distances.

Key Features:

City input through an Excel file (cities_input.xlsx)

Coordinates retrieval using HERE Maps API

Distance matrix computation

Three algorithms implemented for TSP:

Nearest Insertion

Primâ€™s Algorithm

Branch and Bound

Output of optimized tour and total distance
